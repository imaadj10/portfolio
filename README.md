### About the Project

This portfolio website combines my love of astronomy with my love of software engineering. This is my first project using Three.js and it allowed me to learn plenty about 3-D graphics, including all the hassles of dealing with cameras and lighting. It is also my first solo project working with React, which has been really interesting to use and has made frontend development infinitely more interesting to me. The website works by letting users navigate to each planet in the planetary system, those planets each representing some aspect of my professional self. I combine the Three.js models with Mantine info cards to create a fluid and appealing user experience. Please enjoy learning more about me from my website!
